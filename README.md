## 🎵 What can Melody Mate do?

### 🎼 Scales & Keys

- Select from all common keys and scales (major, minor, modes, and more)
- Instantly switch the key/scale for your entire melody

### 🔗 Chord Progressions (Custom & Predefined)

- Enable/disable chord progression guidance for melody generation
- Build your own custom chord progressions (drag & drop, reorder, remove, up to 8 chords)
- Choose from a library of predefined progressions (pop, jazz, minor, etc.)
- Diatonic chord palette adapts to your selected key/scale
- Adjustable "Chord Adherence" (how strictly the melody follows the chords)
- Visual chord info: compact names, roman numerals, color coding

### 🥁 Rhythm Design (Presets, Euclidean, Custom)

- **Presets:** Choose from a large library of weighted rhythm patterns (categorized)
- **Euclidean:** Generate mathematically even rhythms, rotate patterns, visualize as a circle
- **Custom Sequencer:** 16-step grid, drag & drop note values, create any rhythm you want
- Rhythm licks: Inject short, predefined rhythmic phrases for extra groove
- Rest probability: Control how sparse or syncopated your melody is
- Random rhythm option within a category

### 🎶 Melody Generation & Structure

- Rule-based generation with N-Gram/Markov-Chain models (adjustable context length)
- Motif repetition: Repeat melodic motifs with customizable patterns
- Famous motif injection: Seed your melody with iconic motifs (Beethoven, pop, etc.)
- Melodic contour: Guide the overall shape (arc, ascending, descending, random)
- Call & response: Motif variation with transposition/inversion
- Start/end on root note (optional)
- Adjustable bars (1–16), BPM, octave range

### 🔊 Dynamics & Velocity

- Fixed velocity: All notes at the same volume
- Dynamic progressions: Choose from musical dynamic curves (piano, forte, etc.)
- Select and preview dynamic profiles

### 🎹 Instrument Selection & Playback

- Choose from 100+ General MIDI instruments (grouped by type)
- Instant playback in your browser (no plugins needed)
- Loop playback option

### 👀 Animated Melody Visualization

- See your melody as a sequence of colored note cards
- Animated playback: highlights the current note in sync with audio
- Octave color coding, velocity transparency, rest indication
- Rhythm legend and info (including custom/euclidean/preset type)

### 💾 MIDI Export

- Download your melody as a .mid file for use in any DAW or music software
- Filename auto-generated based on your settings

### 🧠 Smart User Experience

- Modern, responsive UI (PrimeVue, TailwindCSS)
- All settings grouped in collapsible panels for clarity
- Tooltips, legends, and help texts throughout the app
- **Automatic settings save:** All your preferences, custom rhythms, progressions, and options are automatically saved in your browser (localStorage). When you return, everything is instantly restored—no login or account needed. This ensures a seamless workflow and lets you pick up exactly where you left off, even after closing the browser.
