# Melody Mate

Melody Mate is a web-based tool for generating MIDI melodies. With just a few clicks, you can create, customize, listen to, and export your own melodies as MIDI files‚Äîno musical background required.

## ‚ú® What can Melody Mate do?

- **Choose scale & key:** Ensure every note fits harmonically.
- **Design rhythms:** Create your own rhythms, use presets, or explore Euclidean rhythms.
- **Rule-based generation:** Control the melody with N-Gram/Markov-Chain models, motifs, rest probability, and more.
- **Composition parameters:** Set length (1‚Äì4 bars), tempo (BPM), octave, and velocity.
- **Instruments:** Choose from over 100 General MIDI instruments.
- **Playback:** Listen to your melody directly in the browser.
- **Visualization:** Instantly see the generated note sequence.
- **MIDI export:** Download your melody as a .mid file for use in your DAW.
