# Melody Mate

A web-based MIDI melody generator built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite for crafting rule-based musical melodies. This tool allows you to generate unique, harmonically consistent tunes by defining a set of constraints and generation parameters.

## ✨ Features

- **🎼 Scale & Key:** Choose from a variety of musical scales to ensure every generated note is harmonically correct.
- **🥁 Rhythm Definition:** Create custom rhythmic patterns by selecting note durations and subdivisions.
- **🤖 Rule-Based Generation:** The core of Melody Mate uses an N-gram (Markov chain) model for melody generation. You can influence the outcome by:
  - Using predefined musical motifs to train the generation model.
  - Repeating motifs across the melody.
  - Adjusting the probability of rests to create more varied rhythms.
  - Forcing the melody to start on the root note of the selected scale.
- **🎛️ Composition Controls:**
  - **Length:** Set the melody length from 1 to 4 bars.
  - **Tempo:** Adjust the Beats Per Minute (BPM).
  - **Octave:** Define the target octave for the melody.
- **🎹 Playback & Visualization:**
  - Listen to your creation directly in the browser with an integrated sampler.
  - See the generated notes on a piano roll visualizer.
- **MIDI Export:** Download your melody as a `.mid` file to use in any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
